Tour-Hanoi
I realised this project in cooperation with Thomas Gub√©no. It's a AR version of the hanoi tower game, it runs on android. Developped with vuforia on Unity.

my contribution to the project:

system of moving the disks
"animation" of the disks
possibility to change the number of disks (with automatic resize)
download the APK on your phone and print the content of file "Photos Cartes", then when you launch the game point your camera toward the printed cards, you should see the structure of the game appear.
